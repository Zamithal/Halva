# Halva
## About
Halva is a procedural dungeon crawler developed by Skyler Swenson in Unreal Engine 4. Halva is a virtual reality game designed to be run on the HTC Vive. Halva uses room-scale VR to create a dynamic combat experience and therefore does not support VR setups that do not utilize roomscale VR.

# Halva
## About
Halva is a procedural dungeon crawler developed by Skyler Swenson for Windows. Halva is a virtual reality game designed to be run on the HTC Vive. Halva uses room-scale VR to create a dynamic combat experience and therefore does not support VR setups that do not utilize roomscale VR. If you have come to this page looking for the game, head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/Zamithal/Halva/releases).
